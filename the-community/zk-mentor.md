We fully understand that people have a life outside of ZKsync and the ZKmentor program and therefore we do not expect people to spend all their time as a ZKmentor nor do we recommend it. However, we expect participants to maintain the same activity level throughout. This means that becoming a ZKmentor  isn't an end goal, but it's rather here where the fun begins!

If youâ€™re not able to to dedicate sufficient time to the ZKmentor Program we would suggest you wait before applying until youâ€™re in a position where you have more time to dedicate.
