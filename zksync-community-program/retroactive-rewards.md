# Retroactive Rewards

### Why Retroactive Incentives?

While the **ZKsync Community Program** primarily focuses on proactive incentives to **reward ongoing contributions**, it also recognizes the importance of acknowledging those who have already played a key role in shaping and growing the ecosystem. To ensure fairness, the program manager has included **retroactive rewards for contributions made in 2024 by eligible roles**.

### Who is Eligible?

Retroactive incentives will be distributed to community members who **actively contributed before the launch of the ZKsync Community Program**, specifically those holding the following **roles** in 2024:

ðŸ”¹ Community Moderator

ðŸ”¹ Language Moderator

ðŸ”¹ ZK Success member

ðŸ”¹ ZK Star member

### How Are Retroactive Rewards Calculated?

Contributions from January to December 2024 are evaluated based on several key factors:&#x20;

* **Security (Anti Spam / Scam) efforts**: Helping secure Discord channels, monitoring for suspicious activity, and supporting anti-scam processes.
* **Community support**: Actively assisting and guiding other members in Discord.
* **Engagement**: Participation in discussions and initiatives in Discord language channels and general channels.
* **Impact**: Meaningful contributions that have supported the growth of the ecosystem.
* **Alignment** with role expectations.

Contributions to **security** had the greatest weight, followed by **community support**,  **engagement** in language channels and then in the general channel.

**Rewards are not automatically assigned**: eligibility is determined based on a structured review process conducted by Gitcoin.
