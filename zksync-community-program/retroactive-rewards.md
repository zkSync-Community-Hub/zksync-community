# Retroactive Rewards

### Why Retroactive Incentives?

While the Z**Ksync Community Program** primarily focuses on proactive incentives to reward ongoing contributions, it is equally important to acknowledge those who have already played a key role in shaping and growing the ecosystem. To ensure fairness, the program manager has included **retroactive rewards for contributions made in early 2024**.

### Who is Eligible?

Retroactive incentives will be distributed to community members who **actively contributed before the launch of the program**, specifically those holding the following roles:

ðŸ”¹ Community Moderators

ðŸ”¹ Language Moderators

ðŸ”¹ ZK Success members

ðŸ”¹ ZK Star members

### How Are Retroactive Rewards Calculated?

â€¢ Contributions from January 2024 onward are evaluated based on several key factors: **security efforts** (helping secure Discord channels, monitoring for suspicious activity, and supporting anti-scam processes), **community support** (actively assisting and guiding other members), **engagement** (participation in discussions and initiatives), **impact** (meaningful contributions that drive ecosystem growth), and **alignment** with role expectations.

â€¢ **Rewards are not automatically assigned**: eligibility is determined based on a structured review process conducted by Gitcoin.

### Distribution, Privacy and Onboarding

â€¢ Retroactive rewards will be **distributed privately**: no individual reward amounts will be publicly shared.

â€¢ Recipients will receive **direct communication about their eligibility and next steps**.

â€¢ Eligible recipients will need to complete a **dedicated onboarding process**, which includes KYC verification for compliance purposes.

### Token Lock Period

â€¢ Distributed ZK Tokens will be **locked for 40 days** after receipt.

â€¢ For U.S.-based contributors, tokens will be **locked for 365 days** due to regulatory requirements.

### Next Steps & Further Details

**Gitcoin will provide additional details** on the retroactive rewards distribution process, including instructions for onboarding, KYC verification, and claiming tokens. More updates will be shared through official Gitcoin and ZKsync communication channels.
