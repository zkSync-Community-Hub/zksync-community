# Reporting of Monthly Activities

The **ZKsync Community Program** operates on a **structured monthly assessment process** to ensure that all rewards are fairly distributed based on actual contributions. This process is designed to maintain transparency, accountability, and fairness in how active participants are recognized and compensated.

Each month, contributors must self-report their activities, which are then reviewed and verified before rewards are distributed.

***

## Monthly Activity Assessment Process

To qualify for rewards, **participants must meet the minimum engagement thresholds** assigned to their respective roles. The assessment process consists of the following steps:

<details>

<summary>Self-Reporting Form Submission</summary>

â€¢ At the end of each month, participants submit a **structured self-assessment** form documenting their contributions through a dedicated form.

â€¢ The form includes **details on engagement in discussions, event participation, campaign involvement, and Squad activities**.

â€¢ Participants must provide verifiable proof of their activities (e.g., links, recaps).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Review &#x26; Verification</summary>

â€¢ Gitcoin, in collaboration with Community Moderators, will **review self-reported contributions and compare them against community platform analytics** (engagement metrics, activity logs, impact, sentiment, event participation records).

â€¢ Any discrepancies or incomplete submissions may result in **disqualification** for that month.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Final Review &#x26; Reward Allocation</summary>

â€¢ Once contributions are verified, and KYC is completed, eligible participants receive their full monthly reward according to their role.

â€¢ If a participant **fails to meet the minimum engagement criteria**, they will not receive rewards for that month and may be flagged for removal if inactivity persists.

## Ensuring Fairness in Assessments

To prevent abuse and ensure the integrity of the program, self-reported data will be cross-checked against:

âœ” **Community platform analytics** (e.g., Discord engagement, governance participation logs).

âœ” **Moderator & Gitcoin program manager evaluations**.

âœ” **Verification of provided proof** (e.g., links to hosted discussions, engagement stats, campaign interactions).

âš  **Failure to provide accurate or verifiable information may lead to disqualification for that monthâ€™s rewards. Repeated violations may result in removal from the program.**

## What Happens After the Assessment?

ðŸ“¢ Participants who meet the monthly engagement thresholds for their role will be eligible to receive the full reward. To claim it, they must successfully complete the KYC verification process before distribution.\
