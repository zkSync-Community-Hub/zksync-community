# How It Works

The **ZKsync Community Program** is designed to **recognize, reward, and structure community participation**, ensuring that active contributors are fairly compensated for their engagement and impact. By **aligning incentives with meaningful contributions**, the program strengthens the communityâ€™s role in ecosystem expansion, education, and governance participation.

***

## Total ZK Tokens Allocated and Purpose

**Over 5 million ZK Tokens** have been allocated for Gitcoin-managed distribution over the next six months, ensuring that contributors are rewarded for their efforts in expanding and supporting the ecosystem.

The total allocation is split into **two categories**:

âœ… **50% for Proactive Incentives** â€“ Distributed monthly to eligible community members who actively contribute through engagement, campaigns, and structured activities.

âœ… **50% for Retroactive Rewards** â€“ Designed to recognize past contributions that have helped shape and grow the ZKsync ecosystem.

This balanced approach ensures that contributors are rewarded for both past efforts and for ongoing engagement in shaping ZKsyncâ€™s future.

#### **The program aims to:**

âœ” Encourage long-term **community participation** in ZKsyncâ€™s growth.

âœ” **Support key contributors** who help drive engagement and onboard new users.

âœ” Create structured **pathways for participation**, enabling the community to scale alongside the Elastic Network.
