# Rewards Distribution

The **ZKsync Community Program** is designed to be **transparent and meritocratic,** ensuring that rewards are tied directly to participation and impact.&#x20;

***

## Prevent inactive participation and maintain fairness

‚úÖ **Minimum engagement thresholds** are set for each role. Contributors must meet these activity requirements to remain eligible. More details on the engagement thresholds will be shared by Gitcoin.

‚úÖ **Self-reporting is required**: Participants must submit a structured activity log each month.

‚úÖ **Contributions are verified** through analytics and moderator reviews to confirm participation and prevent abuse.

## Evaluation Process Before Rewards Are Distributed

To ensure accuracy, fairness, and accountability, all rewards go through a multi-step evaluation process before distribution:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Self-Reporting Form Submission

At the end of each month, participants submit a **structured activity report** documenting their engagement through a dedicated form.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Review & Verification

Gitcoin and Community Moderators **cross-check reports against analytics** from community platforms, ensuring engagement metrics match reported activities.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Final Validation by Gitcoin & Community Moderators

The program manager **verifies that contributions meet program criteria** and align with engagement standards.

Any discrepancies or missing information are flagged for review.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Rewards Distribution

After the review is complete, **rewards are distributed** monthly.

## How the Rewards are Assessed:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Each month, **up to the maximum number of participants per role can qualify for rewards**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Rewards are fixed per role**; if a participant meets the role‚Äôs minimum contribution requirements, they receive the full reward for that role.

3Ô∏è‚É£ If more contributors qualify than the available spots, **selection will be based on**:\
‚Ä¢ Quality of engagement\
‚Ä¢ Impact of contributions\
‚Ä¢ Consistency in fulfilling role expectations\
‚Ä¢ Prioritizing contributors who demonstrate sustained, high-quality involvement

4Ô∏è‚É£ If fewer contributors qualify than the available spots, only the ones meeting the minimum contribution thresholds will receive rewards.
