# Language Channels and Moderators

The **ZKsync Community Program** recognizes the importance of **global accessibility and inclusivity**. As ZKsyncâ€™s ecosystem expands, language-specific community channels serve as vital hubs for engagement, education, and onboarding for non-English-speaking users. To ensure these channels remain active, informative, and welcoming, the program includes **Language Moderators**, a specialized role dedicated to supporting regional communities.

ðŸ“¢ Note: The Language Moderator role will be implemented **starting from the second month of the program**. Rewards will be distributed **only if the language channel meets engagement thresholds,** which will be defined and communicated by Gitcoin.

## Language Channels: Strengthening Global Participation

ZKsyncâ€™s community spans diverse regions, and language channels allow users to **engage in discussions, ask questions, and stay updated in their preferred language**. These channels foster a more inclusive and decentralized community, ensuring that the ecosystem remains open to contributors from all backgrounds.

âœ” Facilitate discussions and engagement in local languages.

âœ” Help onboard new users by answering questions and providing relevant resources.
