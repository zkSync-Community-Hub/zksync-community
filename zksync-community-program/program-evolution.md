# Program Evolution

The **ZKsync Community Program** is not just about rewarding contributions, it is **designed to be community-driven, transparent, and adaptable**. Over the course of six months, community members will actively contribute to shape the program’s future, helping refine its structure, ensure fairness, and build a sustainable model for long-term engagement.

***

## How the Community Will Contribute to the Program Evolution

Participants will have **multiple opportunities to influence and improve the program**, ensuring that it evolves based on real experiences and community needs. Governance within the program is not just about receiving rewards; it’s about making meaningful contributions to how the ZKsync community operates.

The program’s governance evolution will focus on:

✔ **Refining Reward Mechanisms** – Ensuring fair distribution and alignment with contribution impact.

✔ **Improving Participation Pathways** – Optimizing how new members onboard and engage.

✔ **Strengthening Community Self-Sustainability** – Laying the foundation for a long-term community-led framework.

## Mechanisms for Feedback & Improvement

The ZKsync Community Program is built to listen, iterate, and evolve based on direct community input. The following mechanisms ensure a structured way for contributors to provide feedback and collaborate on improvements:

### 1️⃣ Squads

✔ **Dedicated Squads** will be formed to drive structured discussions on community governance, rewards, and program improvements.

✔ Members can participate in **working groups** focused on community governance, events, onboarding, and engagement strategy.

✔ Squads will regularly **share insights and proposals** with Gitcoin and other ZKsync ecosystem stakeholders.

### 2️⃣ Surveys & Feedback Loops

✔ Regular **community survey**s will be conducted to assess satisfaction, challenges, and suggestions.

✔ Contributors will **vote on key improvements**, helping to define adjustments to role expectations, activities, and rewards.

✔ The community’s insights will directly **inform the program’s long-term framework**.

***

## The Long-Term Vision: A Self-Sustaining Community Governance Model

While the ZKsync Community Program is initially managed by Gitcoin, its long-term goal is to **transition toward a more governance-driven model** where the community manages and evolves its own participation structure.

### Key milestones on the path to a self-sustaining model:

✔ **Refining community leadership roles** – Strengthening the responsibilities and decision-making power of active contributors.

✔ **Building community infrastructure** – Establishing a framework for long-term program oversight by community-elected representatives.

✔ **Defining sustainability strategies** – Ensuring that the program continues beyond six months in alignment with community governance structures like the Token Assembly.
