However, we expect participants to maintain the same activity level throughout. This means that becoming a ZKmentor  isn't an end goal, but it's rather here where the fun begins!

If you‚Äôre not able to to dedicate sufficient time to the ZKmentor Program we would suggest you wait before applying until you‚Äôre in a position where you have more time to dedicate.
