This six-month program is a foundational step toward building a long-term, self-sustaining community within the ZKsync ecosystem. By structuring participation and aligning incentives, it ensures that contributors play an active role in shaping governance, adoption, and engagement across the Elastic Network. Over time, insights from this program will help define how the community evolves and integrates into ZKsyncâ€™s decentralized future.
