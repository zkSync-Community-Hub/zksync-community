# Rewards Distribution

The **ZKsync Community Program** is designed to be **transparent and meritocratic,** ensuring that rewards are tied directly to participation and impact. By maintaining structured evaluation criteria, the program ensures fairness and accountability, keeping rewards aligned with meaningful contributions.

***

## Prevent inactive participation and maintain fairness

✅ **Minimum engagement thresholds** are set for each role. Contributors must meet these activity requirements to remain eligible. More details will be shared by Gitcoin.

✅ **Self-reporting is required**: Participants must submit a structured activity log each month.

✅ **Contributions are verified** through analytics and moderator reviews to confirm participation and prevent abuse.

## Evaluation Process Before Rewards Are Distributed

To ensure accuracy, fairness, and accountability, all rewards go through a multi-step evaluation process before distribution:

### 1️⃣ Self-Reporting Form Submission

• At the end of each month, participants submit a structured activity report documenting their engagement through a dedicated form.

### 2️⃣ Review & Verification

• Gitcoin and Community Moderators cross-check reports against analytics from community platforms, ensuring engagement metrics match reported activities.

### 3️⃣ Final Validation by Gitcoin & Community Moderators

• The program manager verifies that contributions meet program criteria and align with engagement standards.

• Any discrepancies or missing information are flagged for review.

### 4️⃣ Rewards Distribution

• After the review is complete, rewards are distributed at the end of each month.

***

## How the Rewards are Assessed:

1️⃣ Each month, up to the maximum number of participants per role can qualify for rewards.

2️⃣ Rewards are fixed per role; if a participant meets the role’s minimum contribution requirements, they receive the full reward for that role.

3️⃣ If more contributors qualify than the available spots, selection will be based on:

• Quality of engagement

• Impact of contributions

• Consistency in fulfilling role expectations

• Prioritizing contributors who demonstrate sustained, high-quality involvement

4️⃣ If fewer contributors qualify than the available spots, only the eligible ones will receive rewards.
