# How It Works

The ZKsync Community Program is designed to recognize, reward, and structure community participation, ensuring that active contributors are fairly compensated for their engagement and impact. By aligning incentives with meaningful contributions, the program strengthens the community‚Äôs role in ecosystem expansion, education, and governance participation.

***

## Total ZK Tokens Allocated and Purpose

Over 5 million ZK Tokens have been allocated for Gitcoin-managed distribution over the next six months, ensuring that contributors are rewarded for their efforts in expanding and supporting the ecosystem.

\
The total allocation is split into two categories:

‚úÖ 50% for Proactive Incentives ‚Äì Distributed monthly to eligible community members who actively contribute through engagement, campaigns, and structured activities.

‚úÖ 50% for Retroactive Rewards ‚Äì Designed to recognize past contributions that have helped shape and grow the ZKsync ecosystem.



This balanced approach ensures that contributors are rewarded not only for past efforts but also for ongoing engagement in shaping ZKsync‚Äôs future.



The program aims to:

‚úî Encourage long-term community participation in ZKsync‚Äôs growth.

‚úî Support key contributors who help drive engagement and onboard new users.

‚úî Create structured pathways for participation, enabling the community to scale alongside the Elastic Network.

## Monthly Rewards & Maximum Participants Per Role

To ensure fair and predictable rewards, the program has a fixed number of eligible spots per role each month.

### üí∞ Monthly Compensation Per Role:

‚Ä¢ Community Moderators: 7,000 ZK Tokens per month.

‚Ä¢ Captains: 4,500 ZK Tokens per month.

‚Ä¢ Mateys: 2,250 ZK Tokens per month.



### üìå Maximum Number of Eligible Participants Per Month:

‚Ä¢ Community Moderators: Up to 4

‚Ä¢ Captains: Up to XX (TBD)

‚Ä¢ Mateys: Up to 40

#### How It Works:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Each month, up to the maximum number of participants per role can qualify for rewards.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Rewards are fixed per role‚Äîif a participant meets the role‚Äôs minimum contribution requirements, they receive the full reward for that role.

3Ô∏è‚É£ If more contributors qualify than the available spots, selection will be based on:

‚Ä¢ Quality of engagement

‚Ä¢ Impact of contributions

‚Ä¢ Consistency in fulfilling role expectations

‚Ä¢ Prioritizing contributors who demonstrate sustained, high-quality involvement

4Ô∏è‚É£ If fewer contributors qualify than the available spots, only the eligible ones will receive rewards.



This system ensures fairness, maintains quality standards, and prevents passive participation while rewarding those who actively contribute to the ecosystem.

## Ensuring Fair Distribution of Rewards

The ZKsync Community Program is designed to be transparent and meritocratic, ensuring that rewards are tied directly to participation and impact. To prevent inactive participation and maintain fairness:\


‚úÖ Minimum engagement thresholds are set for each role. Contributors must meet these activity requirements to remain eligible.

‚úÖ Self-reporting is required: Participants must submit a structured activity log each month.

‚úÖ Contributions are verified through analytics and moderator reviews to confirm participation and prevent abuse.



By maintaining structured evaluation criteria, the program ensures fairness and accountability, keeping rewards aligned with meaningful contributions.

***

## Evaluation Process Before Rewards Are Distributed

To ensure accuracy, fairness, and accountability, all rewards go through a multi-step evaluation process before distribution:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Self-Reporting Form Submission

‚Ä¢ At the end of each month, participants submit a structured activity report documenting their engagement.

‚Ä¢ The report must include links, proof of contribution, and details on completed tasks.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Review & Verification

‚Ä¢ Gitcoin and Community Moderators cross-check reports against analytics from community platforms, ensuring engagement metrics match reported activities.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Final Validation by Gitcoin & Community Moderators

‚Ä¢ The program manager verifies that contributions meet program criteria and align with engagement standards.

‚Ä¢ Any discrepancies or missing information are flagged for review.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Rewards Distribution

‚Ä¢ After the review is complete, rewards are distributed at the end of each month.\


This multi-step review process guarantees that only eligible, engaged participants receive rewards while ensuring full transparency.
