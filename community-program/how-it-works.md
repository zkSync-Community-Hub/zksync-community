# How It Works

The program is managed by the Gitcoin, with Discord Admins and Community Moderators assessing participant activities each month. Contributors meeting the engagement and activity thresholds are rewarded accordingly.

### **Key Mechanisms**:

* Gitcoin, with Admins and Mods, tracks participation and engagement using analytics tools and monthly feedback.
* Activities are reviewed holistically to ensure fairness and transparency in rewarding contributors.

### **How Rewards Are Determined**:

* Contributions are assessed based on qualitative and quantitative metrics.
* Only participants meeting the monthly thresholds are eligible for rewards.
